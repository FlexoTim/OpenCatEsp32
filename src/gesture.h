  APDS-9960 - Gesture Sensor
  https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduino_apds9960/

  This example reads gesture data from the on-board APDS-9960 sensor of the
  Nano 33 BLE Sense and prints any detected gestures to the Serial Monitor.

  Gesture directions are as follows:
  - UP:    from USB connector towards antenna
  - DOWN:  from antenna towards USB connector
  - LEFT:  from analog pins side towards digital pins side
  - RIGHT: from digital pins side towards analog pins side

  The circuit:
  - Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

  This example code is in the public domain.
